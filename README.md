<h2>Hey folks,</h2>
<h2>This is my first project while learning web development.</h2> 
<h3>It is basically a code editor which works with HTML,CSS and JavaScript. It is a simplified version of "CodePen".</h3>
<h3>Key features: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are three sections: each for HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</li>
  <li>There is one section for the OUTPUT of the CODE that we type respectively in those three sections</li>
  <li>Toggle buttons are available for each of the section to open or close</li>
</ul>
